# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us through the following steps:
1. Reach out to me (Voylin) or one of the mods on the Discord server;
1. Create an issue in the GitHub repo (if there is a very high security risk, please reach out to us directly instead).

How to report a security vulnerability:
1. Include details about the vulnerability (how to reproduce it, context in which it happens, ...);
1. Also include the OS if this matters;
1. Basically any info needed, I think you probably knows how it works to report any security vulnerability.
