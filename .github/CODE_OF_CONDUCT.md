# Contributor Code of Conduct

We want a harassment-free experience for everyone. No discrimination of any kind will be accepted. You give respect and receive respect on both sides. Any discussion happened? Make it up afterwards.

Just please use common sense, I don't think I should write this kind of a code of conduct to be honest but some people lack basic common sense so here are some bullet points:
- Age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, religion, race, nationality, ... Don't discriminate on any of those as in the end we are all a moving bag of bones, we are all humans so treat each other with mutual respect;
- Lack of experience is not a reason to not listen to someone or to value their opinion, learn from each other;
- No cursing please, I am not someone who curses - at all - and I don't see the value in it either;
- Don't waste people their time (by creating useless issues, PR's, comments, ...). Think twice before pressing the send button;

It's very simple, don't be a bad person and you are free to stay. ;)
