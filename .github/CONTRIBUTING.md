## Contributing code
We welcome code contributions! Please follow these steps to make contributions go more smoothly:

### Project overview
GDE GoZen is an open-source GDExtension for the Godot game engine which provides video playback for multiple video file types. The primary languages used are GDScript and C++ (for the GDExtension). The project is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license, partly due to the use of FFmpeg with the GPL-compatible codecs. GDE GoZen will stay open-source under the GPL license, even if we end up moving away from FFmpeg since most libraries for handling video files fall under this license anyway.

### Setting up your development enviroment
1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Get the latest stable version of [the Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org);
    * Install git;
    * Familiarity with GDScript and Godot workflow ([Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/));
    * Familiarity with C++ (and GDExtension);
    * (Optional) knowledge of video/audio formats and FFmpeg can be helpful;
1. **Fork the repo:**
    * [Fork the GDE GoZen project from GitHub](https://github.com/VoylinsGamedevJourney/gde_gozen/fork) to create your own copy of GDE GoZen to work in;
    * Clone your fork to your local machine
1. **Build the GDE:**
    * Run `build.py` with python3;
    * Follow the steps to build for your system (choose debug);
1. **Open project in Godot:**
    * Opening the project can be done through launching Godot and opening the project which is inside the src folder.

### Your first code contribution
1. Make certain you have pulled all commits from upstream and that you are inside of the `master` branch;
1. Create a new branch with a descriptive name related to the feature or bug fix you want to implement;
1. Make your changes, write your code, fix bugs, ...;
1. Test your changes, be certain that it doesn't break anything else and that it works as expected;
1. Follow the coding style, there's no document yet outlining the style so base it upon the other scripts for now;
1. Write a clear commit message about the change you made;
1. Commit and push your changes, afterwards create a pull request;

From there we will review the code and test it ourselves as well. If everything is okay, we merge the PR. If not, we will ask for some changes to happen. Once merged: Congratulations, you've contributed to GDE GoZen!

## Documentation contributions
Improving documentation (README, code comments, Godot docs, Wiki) is a valuable contribution! If you see something unclear or missing, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request with your proposed changes.

## Translations
Translation contributions are not yet necessary due to the early alpha stage, but we plan to add support for internationalization in the future. Stay tuned!
